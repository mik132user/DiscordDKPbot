#DiscordDKPbot

##Introduction

This project is designed to display player statistics using a Discord bot.

##Technologies
This project is developed entirely in Python.

##Installation
The project was initially created for Kingdom 3330 but can be adapted for use with other kingdoms as well. To set it up, start the ‘creator_bot_files_V2.bat’ file and follow the instructions. You will need to input:
Your bot token: To get this, create a project on the Discord Developer Portal.
Your kingdom’s number.
The channel ID where you want the bot to operate: To obtain the channel ID, enable Developer Mode (go to Discord → Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode), then right-click on the desired channel.
The program will automatically create all the necessary files for the bot.
Note: The bot only displays statistics, which must be stored in the data/DKP(kingdom_number).db file.

##Features
The application includes the following functionalities:
User authentication (registration and login).
Task management with due dates and priorities.
Task categorization.
Data persistence with SQLite3.
Responsive design for both mobile and desktop.

##Project Status
